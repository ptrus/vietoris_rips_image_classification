\begin{homeworkProblem}[The classification model]

\begin{definition}[Vietoris-Rips complex]
\label{defa}
Let $X$ be a a set of $m$-dimensional points $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $d$ be a metric. Pick a parameter $r > 0$. Construct a simplicial complex as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add a $0$-simplex for each point in $X$.
	\item For $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$ add a $1$-simplex between $x_{1}, x_{2}$ if $d(x_{1}, x_{2}) \leq r$.
	\item For $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \in X$ add a $2$-simplex with vertices $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ if $d(x_{1}, x_{2}), d(x_{1}, x_{3}), d(x_{2}, x_{3}) \leq r$.
	\item ...
	\item For $x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{m} \in X$, add a $(m-1)$-simplex with vertices $x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{m}$ if $d(x_{i}, x_{j}) \leq r$ for $0 \leq i,j \leq m$; that is, if all the points are within a distance of $r$ from each other.
\end{itemize}
The simplicial complex is called the Vietoris-Rips complex and is denoted $VR_{r}(X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{homeworkSection}{Relation to single linkage clustering algorithm}

Our intuition tells us, that the model we build using the Vietoris-Rips complex to classify the images, produces the same results as the well known single linkage clustering algorithm. In this section we aim to prove or at least give a strong intuition that this is indeed the case.

\begin{definition}
We say that disjoint subsets $A_{1}...A_{k}$ of vertices $V$ in graph $G(V,E)$ are $k$ connected components of the graph $G$ if the following is true:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The vertices inside $A_{i}$ are connected i.e. there exists a path between arbitrary two vertices $a, b \in A_{i}$, for every $i \in 1...k$.
	\item The sets of vertices $A_{1},...,A_{k}$ are disconnected i.e. there isn't an edges $e(a, b)$ between a pair of two points $(a,b)$ such that $a \in A_{i}, b \in A_{j}, i \neq j$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Both algorithms take a set $X$ of $n$ samples with $m$ features as input. We can think of a sample $x$ in the set $X$ as a point in the $m$-dimensional space $x \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. The algortihms then constructs a graph with points $X$ as the vertices ($V$) and edges $E$. The $k$ connected components in the constructed graph corespond to the classes of samples.

\begin{paragraph}{Single linkage algorithm.}
The algorithm starts with $n$ connected components (no edges in the graph). n each step the algorithm chooses the two connected components that are closest to each according to some distance metric $d$ (in our case the euclidean distance) and joins them into one by adding an edge between their closest two vertices. 

\begin{definition}
The distance $D$ between two connected components $A$ and $B$ is defined as the distance of the pair of vertices (one from $A$ and one from $B$) that are closest to each other. More formally
$$D(A, B) =  \min_{a \in A, b \in B} d(a,b).$$
\end{definition}

The algorithm stops when there are only $k$ connected components left.

\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}{Vietoris-Rips classification algorithm.}
The algorithm builds a ($1$-dimensional) Vietoris-Rips complex $V_{r}(X)$ with parameter $r$. We choose the biggest $r$ such that the Vietoris-Rips complex $V_{r}(X)$ has $k$ connected components.
\end{paragraph}
\\
\\
To prove that the two algorithms indeed produce the same connected components we will first prove the next claim.

\begin{claim}\label{claima}
Let $G_{sl}(V, E_{sl})$ be a graph produced by the single linkage algorithm for finding $k$ clusters and let $d_{max}$ denote the distance between vertices in graph $G_{sl}$ that were connected in the last iteration of the algorithm. Graph $G_{sl}$ has connected components $A_{1}...A_{k}$. The graph $G_{vr}(V, E_{vr})$ induced by the Vietoris-Rips complex $VR_{d_{max}}(V)$ has the same connected components $A_{1}...A_{k}$.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
We prove the Claim~\ref{claima} by induction on the steps in the single linkage algorithm. We start with a set of vertices $V$. Let $j$ denote the step (iteration) of the algorithm, $e_{j}$ the edge added in $j$-th step and $d_{j}$ its length. We claim that at each $j$ the graph $G_{sl}^{j}$ constructed by the algorithm up to that point, has the exact same conected components as $G_{vr}^{j}$, that is the graph induced by the Vietoris-Rips complex $VR_{d_{j}}(V)$.

\begin{paragraph}{Base case.}For $j=0$ this is obvious, since this is the initial state of the algorithm. Both graphs $G_{sl}^{0}$ and $G_{vr}^{0}$ consist only of vertices $V$. For $j=1$ the algorithm adds the smallest edge $e_{1}$ out of all possible candidates and builds a graph $G_{sl}^{1}$. Edge $e_{1}$ has length $d_{1}$. It is obvious that $VR_{d_{1}}(V)$ will induce a graph $G_{vr}^{1}$ that will also only contain edge $e_{1}$, since no other pairwise distance between vertices $V$ is smaller.
\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}{Induction step.}
Here we show that if for some $j$ our claim holds, it will also hold after another iteration of the algorithm i.e. for $j+1$. In $(j+1)$-th iteration, the algortihm finds the edge $e_{j+1}$ with length $d_{j+1}$ and adds it to the graph. By the definition of the algortihm $e_{j+1}$ is the smallest such edge that connects (joins) two seperate connected components. This means that every other edge $e'$ with length $d' < d_{j+1}$ would not join connected components, but would instead just connect two vertices, that are both allready in the same connected component. From the definition of the Vietoris-Rips complex we can see that in the graph $G_{vr}^{j+1}$ there will only be one new edge that will join two seperate connected components, and that will be exactly edge $e_{j+1}$. All the other extra edges that will be added in $G_{vr}^{j+1}$, but do not appear in  $G_{sl}^{j+1}$ have length less than $d_{j+1}$ and will therefore only connect vertices inside of allready existing connected components of the graph $G_{vr}^{j}$. Since by our induction hypothesis graphs $G_{sl}^{j}$ and $G_{vr}^{j}$ had the same connected components and we joined two of the same connected components in both graphs, this means that the graphs $G_{sl}^{j+1}$ and $G_{vr}^{j+1}$ also have the same connected components.
\end{paragraph}\\
\\
We have proven that the graph $G_{sl}^{j}$ constructed in $j$-th iteration of the single linkage algorithm indeed contains the same connected commponents as the graph $G_{vr}^{j}$ induced by $VR_{d_{j}}(V)$ for an arbitrary $j$. This also prooves Claim~\ref{claima}.
\end{proof}

Using Claim~\ref{claima} we see that the connected components in $G_{vr}$ and $G_{sl}$ are indeed the same. We need to take into account that the Vietrois-Rips algorithm takes the biggest such $r$, so that the graph has $k$ connected components, so $r > d_{max}$. But we can quickly see that the extra edges in the graph induced by $V_{r}(V_{sl})$ will not change the connected components. After all we allready have $k$ connected components in $G_{vr}$. To join any two together would mean a violation of a fundemental rule of the algorithm.
