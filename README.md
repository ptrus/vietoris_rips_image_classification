# Vietoris Rips Image Classification
Image classification using Vietoris-Rips complex.

## Project description
As the title implies, the idea behind the project is to use the Vietoris-Rips complex for image classification. We took pictures of three generic objects and preprocessed them so we obtained
their vector representations. The vector representations of images can then be looked on as points in some m-dimensional space. We build the VR-cx over these points for two different parameters. We use the complexes as a classification model for the images and classify them. We also perform several interesting tests on the generated VR-cx.
